# NextBench
NextBench is a collection of wide variety of benchmarks for accessing the performance of LLMs and VLMs and more.

This project aims to make it easy to run IMPORTANT benchmarks across multiple clients/sdks/providers. This is powered by [W&B Weave](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai).

If you would like to see a benchmark/client/sdk/provider added, please open an issue.

This is a work in progress but we will soon be opening it up for public contributions.
